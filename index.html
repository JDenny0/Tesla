  <p id="tribute-info">He was born on 9/10 July 1856 in the village of Smiljan near Gospić. He comes from an Eastern Orthodox family, his father Milutin was an Orthodox priest, and his mother Georgina (Đuka) is from the priestly Orthodox family Mandić. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and one brother, Dane.</p>
  <p id="tribute-info">His education began in his native Smiljan where he attended the local primary school and was taught German, arithmetic and religion, after which he attended the preparatory primary school and middle school in Gospić. After Gospić he moved to Rakovac in Karlovac where he finished secondary school (the Higher Real Gymnasium). He enrolled in the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz with a scholarship from the Military Frontier, but after his scholarship was revoked due to the demilitarization of the Military Frontier, he was not able to finish his second year and he began to play cards and gamble to compensate for the financial loss, but in the end he gave up his studies before his third year. He worked for a short time in Maribor and after his father died in 1879, he worked in the secondary school (Real Gymnasium) in Gospić. In 1880 he tried to enrol at a university in Prague but failed, and a year later he found work in Budapest on the construction of the first telephone exchange.

  <p id="tribute-info">Tesla worked for the Continental Edison Company in Paris, and in 1883 he constructed his first induction motor model in Strasbourg. After returning to Paris, Tesla received a recommendation from Charles Batchelor and moved to New York in 1884, where he was employed at Edison’s company. After a misunderstanding with Edison, Tesla left the company and founded his own in 1885, the Tesla Electric & Manufacturing Company. His company went bankrupt a year later and he had to do manual labour to survive. In 1887 Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Company and patented the following: the polyphase transmission of electricity, induction motor, generators and transformers. A year later, in 1888, Tesla entered into a partnership with George Westinghouse. He sold him patents for alternating current products for a million dollars, but only received USD 60,000 (as listed in some sources).

 

    In 1889 he went back to Europe and visited his native Lika. This was his first trip to Europe since moving to the United States. In 1890 he began to research high frequency current and a year later he developed the Tesla coil (transformer). His second visit to Europe was in 1892 for his mother's funeral and at the time he also visited other European cities: London, Paris, Zagreb, Budapest and Belgrade. Tesla showcased the benefits of alternating current at the 1893 Chicago fair dedicated to achievements in electrical engineering. His laboratory was destroyed in 1895 so he was not able to publish his discovery of electrons and x-rays.</p>

           <h2>Timeline of Nikola Tesla’s life</h2>
    <br>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li><b>1856</b>-At the stroke of midnight, on the night from 9 to 10 July, while a storm was raging and lightning striking in the sky above Smiljan, Nikola Tesla was born. </li>
      <li><b>1862</b>-Tesla enrolled in the first grade of the local primary school in Smiljan where he learned German, arithmetic and religion.</li>

      <li><b>1870</b>-Tesla started secondary school (the Higher Real Gymnasium) in Rakovac near Karlovac which was organised according to the German and Austrian models and was one of the best secondary schools. Tesla’s teacher of mathematics and physics was Martin Sekulić (1833-1905).</li>
      <li><b>1873</b>-After graduation, Tesla returned from Rakovac and contracted cholera, spending the next nine months bed-ridden.</li>
      <li><b>1874</b>-Tesla went to Tomingaj near Gračac to recover from cholera.</li>
      <li><b>1875</b>-Tesla enrolled at the Austrian Polytechnic School in Graz with a scholarship from the Military Frontier.</li>
      <li><b>1876</b>-After his scholarship was revoked due to the demilitarization of the Military Frontier, Tesla failed to finish his second year of study. He tried to cover his expenses by gambling, playing cards and billiards.</li>
      <li><b>1878</b>-Tesla left the Austrian Poytechnic School in Graz before his third-year exams.</li>
      <li><b>1880</b>-Tesla moved to Prague. He failed to enrol at the local University but he still attended classes and was a frequent guest at their library where he followed the latest developments in electrical engineering.</li>
      <li><b>1881</b>-Tesla started to work for the Central Telephone Exchange of Hungary as a drafstman. He was involved in the construction of the first telephone exchange in that city and for two years he worked on the development of the telephone network.</li>
      <li><b>1882</b>-While strolling through a park in Budapest Tesla discovered the principle of the rotating magnetic field. In the fall he went to Paris and got a job repairing direct current power plants with the Continental Edison Company.</li>
      <li><b>1883</b>-Tesla went to Strasbourg where he repaired the installed automatic regulators for the lighting system and designed his first induction motor. He went to Zagreb to get his passport to travel abroad.</li>
      <li><b>1884</b>-Tesla went to New York on the recommendation of Charles Batchelor from Paris and found work at the Edison Company.</li>
      <li><b>1885</b>-After parting ways with Edison, Tesla founded his own Tesla Electric & Manufacturing Company. He worked on the improvement of the arc lighting system and obtained his first patents for inventions.</li>
      <li><b>1887</b>-Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Company with the help of A. S. Brown, director of Western Union. He patented his most famous inventions: the polyphase transmission of electricity, induction motor and corresponding transformers and generators.</li>
      <li><b>1888</b>-He gave a lecture before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) on the advantages of alternating current. He signed a contract with George Westinghouse of the Westinghouse Electric Company.</li>
      <li><b>1890</b>-Tesla started his research of high voltage and high frequency currents in the laboratory on 33-35 South Fifth Avenue in New York.</li>

He applied for various patents, designed the Tesla coil and conflicted with J.J. Thomson who denied Tesla's claim of discovering the electron.</li>
      <li><b>1895</b>-On the 13th of March a fire erupted in Tesla’s laboratory preventing him from further developing and publishing his discovery of X-rays and the electron. He founded a new laboratory at 46-48 East Houston Street and his work there triggered an earthquake that shook Manhattan in July of the same year.</li>
      <li><b>1896</b>-Opening of the Niagara Hydroelectric Power Station. Tesla patented his apparatus for producing ozone. Tesla became an honorary member of the Yugoslav Academy of Science and Arts in Zagreb.</li>

      <li><b>1915</b>-Following the sale of the World Wireless Broadcasting System Station, Tesla declared bankruptcy. New York Times announced that Tesla and Edison would be sharing the Nobel Prize.</li>
      <li><b>1934</b>-Tesla moved to the New Yorker Hotel, suite no. 3327, where he lived until his death.</li>
      <li><b>1943</b>-Tesla died at the age of 86, on 7 January, around 10:30 PM in room no. 3327. on the 33th floor of the New Yorker Hotel.

    <p id="tribute-info"><i>Although I have to thank my mother for my inventiveness, the exercises that my father gave me were very helpful. They contained a multitude of tasks, e.g. guessing other people’s thoughts, detecting various errors or expressions, repeating long sentences or mental calculation. These daily exercises that had strengthened my memory and reason, and in particular helped me develop critical thinking, were undoubtedly very useful.

 

      My mother came from one of the oldest families of this region, and we had invention running in our blood. Both her father and her grandfather invented many appliances for domestic, agriculture and other purposes. Indeed she was a great and extremely capable woman, brave and sure-footed, who rode the storms of her life and learned from those experiences. […] My mother was a first-class inventor who, I believe, would have achieved a lot if only she had not lived so far from modern life and the many opportunities it offered. She invented and developed many devices. She wove beautiful threads that she spun herself. She had even sown seeds, cultivated plants and separated the fibres from them. She worked tirelessly, from dawn until late at night, and much of the clothes we wore and the furniture we had in the house were handmade by her. Past the age of 60 her fingers were still so skilled that she could tie three knots with an eyelash.</i>
